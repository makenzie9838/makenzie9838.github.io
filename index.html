    <p>The genesis of this personal project, 00, is a showcase of what I have done before and a preview of the future.
        00 is a pair of Black Levi's jeans tailored to fit me and embellished with Raccagni zippers. I have had clothing
        tailored by a professional for years. Over time, I experimented with my tailor to make modifications to clothing
        that wasn't your typical alterations. 00 is an example of such a project. A blend of:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>American pragmatism, </li>
            <li>and Italian luxury, </li>
        </ul> 
    <p>00 is my foray into the world of design.</p>
